# Boolean Operations On Implicit Models
Created By: Brendan Petras, Conlan Hanwell, and Cody Fulford

This is a tool that implements boolean operations on implicit models.
The purpose behind the project is to assist modeling instructors teach their students with an interactive simulation.

Currently, Much of the code has been taken from Cody Fulford's Ray Tracer assignment from CPSC 453 - Graphics W16 from the University of Calgary but has been heavily modified

#Controls:
    UP      Move the camera up
    DOWN    Move the camera down
    LEFT    Move the camera left
    RIGHT   Move the camera right
    O       Move the camera away from the scene
    P       Move the camera towards the scene

#The Program   
The program will operate via a real-time ray tracer.

Libraries used:
    GLAD V4.5
    GLFW x86
    GLM
    OpenMP

Currently the ray tacer operates only via the CPU, with multithreading via OpenMP.
